External File Definition of Factory
===================================

In most generation of factories described so far, the definition of factory was directly described in the python file executed, but factories can also be generated by describing them in an external file and loading that file at runtime.

The external definition file is written as follows, in python code, so that the generated factory is bound to the variable :code:`FACTORY`.

.. code-block:: python

    import uuid

    FACTORY = randog.factory.from_example({
        "uuid": uuid.uuid4,
        "name": "",
        "age": 20,
    })

    # (optional) Settings used by 'byfile' mode of command executing
    CSV_COLUMNS = ["uuid", "name", "age"]

.. note::
    In factory definition file, :code:`import randog` can be omitted.

    .. warning::
        As discussed below, :code:`import randog` cannot be omitted if the factory definition file is used as python code other than in from_pyfile or byfile mode.

.. note::
    :code:`CSV_COLUMNS` is used when executing randog as command in byfile mode. See also :doc:`doc.as_command.byfile`.

If you save this file under the name :code:`factory_def.py`, you can use it in your python code as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import randog.factory

    # load factory definition
    factory = randog.factory.from_pyfile("./factory_def.py")

    generated = factory.next()
    assert isinstance(generated["name"], str)

.. seealso::
    The definition file can also be used when executing randog as command in byfile mode such as :code:`python -m randog byfile ./factory_def.py`. See also :doc:`doc.as_command.byfile`.


.. _importable_definition_files:

Importable definition files
---------------------------

Since the definition file is written in python, it can be imported from other python files, but there are some points to note if it is intended to be imported.

For example, see the definition file below:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import randog

    CSV_COLUMNS = ["id", "name"]

    # other python file can import and reuse this
    def create_factory(initial_id):
        return randog.factory.randdict(
            id=randog.factory.increment(initial_id),
            name=randog.factory.randstr(),
        )

    if __name__ == "__randog__":
        initial_id = int(os.environ["INITIAL_ID"])
        FACTORY = create_factory(initial_id)

The following points are noted in this definition file to make it importable:

- write :code:`import randog`; This can only be omitted when this file is executed directly in from_pyfile or byfile mode of command execution, not when it is imported.

- write the process that should not be executed at import in :code:`if __name__ == "__randog__"`; If this is not done, and the environment variable INITIAL_ID is not set or contains non-numbers when imported, an exception will be raised and the python code importing this file will not be executable.

    - You can avoid it by other means, such as proper handling of exceptions. Choose the method appropriate to your situation.
