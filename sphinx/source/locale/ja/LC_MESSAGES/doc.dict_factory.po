"As in this example, by passing value factories as keyword arguments to "
":code:`randdict`, you can create a dict factory that randomly generates "
"each element. By passing a `DictItem "
"<randog.factory.html#randog.factory.DictItem>`_ as an argument instead of"
" a factory, it is also possible to randomize whether the key is generated"
" in the generated dictionary; like :code:`age` in the example above."

"Not limited to dictionaries, :code:`from_example` is a function that, "
"given an object that is an example output, returns a factory that "
"generates an object similar to that example. If a dict is given to "
":code:`from_example`, each of its values can be either an example value "
"or a factory that generates values. Or, if you pass an example wrapped in"
" `DictItemExample <randog.html#randog.DictItemExample>`_, you can also "
"randomize whether or not a key is generated; like :code:`age` in the "
"example above."
